# 2019 Sustainable Scientific Analysis with Data and Code

- **When**: 23-25 October 2019
- **Where**: Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX — rooms change each day!
- **Who**: *Hosted by* [Eric Bruning](mailto:eric.bruning@ttu.edu), TTU Geosciences/ATMO. <br/> *Instructed by* Ryan May and Zach Bruick (Unidata) and John Leeman (Unidata and Leeman Geophysical)
- **What**: Each morning of of this two-day workshop will introduce tools, workflows, and principles for practical scientific danalysis in Python. Four experts will be on hand to help you understand how to apply those tools to your problem each afternoon.
- **How**: Bring a laptop. Before the workshop, follow the [installation instructions](https://unidata.github.io/python-workshop/installation.html). If you have any trouble, please make sure to come early for troubleshooting help.

You will:
Learn how datasets are structured, organized, and stored, from plain text to xarray and NetCDF
Practice encountering and navigating unknown data files, from plain text to GB-scale model data
Learn how to read documentation and adapt community tools to a custom analysis
Learn how to convert analyses from your own research to datasets that can be shared with others
Understand community data standards and best practices for metadata
Practice systematizing your analyses and plots for reproducibility
Learn neat shortcuts and under-the-hood tweaks for common analysis patterns and plots

We will:
Utilize real datasets and peer-contributed code from the atmospheric sciences
Introduce and model how to explore, Google, read documentation, fail, and repeat until you achieve success
